HamFish_5 Notes:
0. Add app into installed app
1. Set up view->urls->

2. Do template

3. view context
    
    def home(request):
    context = {
        #key  : data
        'posts'**: posts
    }
    return render(request, 'blog/home.html', context)

     {% for post in posts** %}
            <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
    
    {% endfor %}

    pass model into views, access through key, use the key in template 


4. Class Based view 
    Model-> view -> urls
    must use template naming convention, <app>/<model>_<view_type>.html
    or change 

    context by dafault call object list
    else use : context_object_name = 'key'

    save lines of codes if stick to convention naming
    SOP : models->views->urls->template

    ps: CreateView use template <model>_form.html
